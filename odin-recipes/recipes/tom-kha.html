        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>           
            This tom kha gai soup recipe (or Thai coconut chicken soup) is absolutely perfect. 
            Rich and creamy yet tangy and salty, this Thai coconut chicken soup recipe is filling 
            but light and positively bursting with flavor. The very best tom kha gai recipe 
            Iâ€™ve ever made or tried. With Whole30, paleo, and vegan options, too.
        </p>

            <li>1 lemongrass stalk <em>pounded</em></li> 
            <li>2 teaspoons red Thai curry paste</li>
            <li>4 cups chicken broth</li>
            <li>4 cups canned coconut cream or coconut milk</li>
            <li>2 medium chicken breasts <em>cut into bite-sized pieces</em></li>
            <li>8 ounces white mushroom caps <em>sliced</em></li>
            <li>1-2 tablespoons coconus sugar</li>
            <li>1 1/2-2 tablespoons fish sauce</li>
            <li>2-3 tablespoons fresh lime juice</li>
            <li>2-3 green onions <em>sliced thin</em></li>
            <li>fresh cilantro <em>chopped</em></li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a medium pot, heat the coconut oil over medium heat. Add the onion, garlic, jalapeno or chile, galangal or ginger, lemongrass, and red curry paste and cook, stirring frequently, for 5 minutes, or until onions are softened. Add chicken broth and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer uncovered for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Strain out the aromatics (the garlic, onions, lemongrass, and ginger) and discard. Add in coconut cream or milk, chicken breast (or tofu or shrimp), and mushrooms. Simmer until chicken breast pieces are just cooked through, then add fish sauce, coconut aminos (or coconut sugar), and lime juice, plus more of each to taste.</li>
            <li>Cook 2 minutes, then ladle into serving bowls and top with sliced green onions and fresh cilantro.</li>
