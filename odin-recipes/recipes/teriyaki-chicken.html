        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            I love chicken teriyaki cooked and eaten with rice and broccoli, but the beauty of this chicken 
            is that you can serve it up with a ton of different sides and it will taste good every time. 
            The flavor combination in the sauce is made with ginger, soy sauce, and garlic, and the aroma 
            in the kitchen makes me so hungry every time. This recipe is simple and easy and tastes like 
            it came straight from a restaurant.

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook Chicken: Cut the chicken into one inch pieces and salt and pepper. Heat olive oil in a wok 
                or skillet over medium high heat and add the chicken. Cook until no longer pink and remove and 
                set aside on a plate.
            </li>
            <li>Whisk: In a small bowl combine the soy sauce, brown sugar, apple cider vinegar, garlic, sesame oil,
                 and ginger. Then, in a separate small bowl whisk the water and cornstarch to make a slurry. Add the
                  cornstarch to the sauce mixture and whisk.
            </li>
            <li>Thicken Sauce: Add the sauce to the skillet and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and then whisk until 
                it starts to thicken.
            </li>
            <li>Toss Chicken with Sauce: Add the chicken back to the skillet and toss until coated and heated through. 
                Garnish with chopped green onions and sesame seeds. Serve over rice if desired.
